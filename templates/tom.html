        <h1>Inspiration for Tom Bombadil</h1>
        <p>I have always loved Lord of the Rings. My favorite parts of the Fellowship of the Ring include Tom Bombadils story
        and the elven realm of Lothlorien. In fact I love Tom's part of the story so much that I will often just play those chapters
        on audible while out for a walk in the woods. I have always been a bit upset that they cut him from the movies so I painted
        this to remind me to be more like Tom. To lovve every creature and person that crosses my path and to go throught life with
        a joyful attitude singing as I go.</p>
