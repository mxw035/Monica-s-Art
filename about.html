            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I grew up on a ranch in Texas. It was a small town so there were not many places for me to learn or experience art.
            We did have a art class once a week at school and I looked forward to it every week. In highschool my family moved to a
            bigger city and I was able to take a more serious art class and compete in local competitions. I have never been the best
            artist but I love the process. I now mostly draw/paint in my spare time using a ipad and procreate. I love this because
            I can enjoy creating art wherever I am. I also enjoy computer science and have been working on desinging websites. This is
            one of my first websites and I am excited to add this medium to my art portfolio. Thanks for stopping by.</p>

            <h1>Future Projects</h1>
            <p>As stated I have recently taken a intrest in computer programing. I had previously practiced as a nurse for the past
            five years. I recently left the medical field to pursue computer science. This website is my final project in my fist class.
            I have enjoyed website developement more than I thought I would and I am excited to continue developing websites for people.
            I also plan to continue drawing or painting whenever inspiration hits. I mostly enjoy attempting to paint beautiful scences of
            nature that I experience in my daily life.</p>
